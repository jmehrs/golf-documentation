## Documentation
- [Pololu 5V, 2.5A Step-Down Voltage Regulator D24V22F5](https://www.pololu.com/product/2858)
## Features
- Input voltage:
    - 4 V to 36 V for the version that outputs 3.3 V
    - \[_output voltage + dropout voltage_\] to 36 V for output voltages of 5 V and higher (see the [dropout voltage section](https://www.pololu.com/product/2858#dropout) for details) 
- Typical maximum continuous output currents between 1.4 A and 2.6 A (see the [maximum continuous output current graph](https://www.pololu.com/product/2858#maxcurrent) below)
- Typical efficiency of 85% to 95%, depending on input voltage, output voltage, and load (see the [efficiency graph](https://www.pololu.com/product/2858#efficiency) below)
- Switching frequency: ~400 kHz
- Integrated reverse-voltage protection, over-current and short-circuit protection, over-temperature shutoff, and soft-start
- 1 mA typical no-load quiescent current; this can be reduced to approximately 5 µA to 10 µA per volt on VIN by disabling the board (see the [quiescent current graph](https://www.pololu.com/product/2858#quiescent) below)
- “Power good” output indicates when the regulator cannot adequately maintain the output voltage
- Compact size: 0.7″ × 0.7″ × 0.31″ (17.8 mm × 17.8 mm × 8 mm)

## Dropout Voltage
The dropout voltage of a step-down regulator is the minimum amount by which the input voltage must exceed the regulator’s target output voltage in order to ensure the target output can be achieved. For example, if a 5 V regulator has a 1 V dropout voltage, the input must be at least 6 V to ensure the output is the full 5 V.

## Efficiency
The efficiency of a voltage regulator, defined as (Power out)/(Power in), is an important measure of its performance, especially when battery life or heat are concerns.

## Continuous Current Output
The maximum achievable output current of these regulators varies with the input voltage but also depends on other factors, including the ambient temperature, air flow, and heat sinking.

## Quiescent Current
The quiescent current is the current the regulator uses just to power itself, and the graph below shows this for the different regulator versions as a function of the input voltage. The module’s EN input can be driven low to put the board into a low-power state where it typically draws between 5 µA and 10 µA per volt on VIN.
